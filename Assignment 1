After reading articles listed in the project file I found that learning about all the aspects of the aurora borealis a.k.a. northern lights
is very extenisve. There are so many different processes happening it would be hard to cover them all effectively for this project. So I 
have decided to narrow down my project to look at the processes invovled with The Earth's Magnetotail. So far the publications I have found
for review are:
1. The Earth's Magnetotail, Hones Jr., Edward; Scientific American, Vol. 254, No. 3 (March 1986), pp. 40-47
2. Interplanery Magnetic Field and The Auroral Zones, Dungey, J.W.; Physical Review Letters, Vol. 6, No. 2 (January 1961), pp. 47-48
3. Motion of Charged Particles in the Magnetosphere, Mukherejee, G. K.; Astrophysics and Space Science,  Vol. 75 (1981), pp. 287-301
4. Magnetic Reconnection: Three-Dimensional Aspects and Onset in the Magnetotail, Hesse, M., IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science, Vol. 28, 
No. 6, (December 2000), pp. 1887-2000
