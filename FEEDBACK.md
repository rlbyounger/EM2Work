# Feedback on Project Work
## Rachel Younger

In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny



## Assignment 1

Rachel, I think this is an interesting phenomenon to investigate. I think you will need to play a little catch up on the paper aspect. Let's say if you can get a short draft by next week, then I can say that you have satisfied the requirement for the other homework sets at an acceptable level. I know that's a lot of work, but it's important to not get too far behind in the paper. I will award you a 16/20 for assignments 2-4 if you complete assignment 5. 

* Score: 18/20
