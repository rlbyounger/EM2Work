## Assignment 6

Rachel, this is a great start to this paper and I think you identify the issues that I would raise about your paper at the moment. One big thing to consider how you explain the models of the aurora in yout paper. Some of the details should be unpacked a bit more in the final draft.

* Score: 16/20

## Assignment 2-5

* Score: 16/20

## Assignment 1

Rachel, I think this is an interesting phenomenon to investigate. I think you will need to play a little catch up on the paper aspect. Let's say if you can get a short draft by next week, then I can say that you have satisfied the requirement for the other homework sets at an acceptable level. I know that's a lot of work, but it's important to not get too far behind in the paper. I will award you a 16/20 for assignments 2-4 if you complete assignment 5.

* Score: 18/20
